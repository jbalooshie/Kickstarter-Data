# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of kickstarter data to predict success of future campaigns

## Summary
I analyzed 4113 kickstarter campaigns from 23 different countries to determine the ideal goal amount, pledge amount, length, and launch date for campaign success. 

### Launch Date
The best month to launch a kickstarter in the theater category is in the month of May. May sees the highest number of successful campaigns. This is consistent across all campaign types. The number of successful campaigns steadily declines as the year goes on.

### Length
The average campaign length for a successful kickstarter is 29 days. For a failed kickstarter it is 34 days. The average length across all campaigns was 33 days. This does not tell us too much, but we should shoot for a campaign that lasts a month. Going beyond that does not increase our odds of success. 

### Goal Amount
